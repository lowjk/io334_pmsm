### PMSM Motor Simulink Model for the IO334 FPGA module

This repo contains the test and main models for the simulation of PMSM motors on the IO334 FPGA module. Models in _hdw_ folders require hardware interfacing via the I/O box or IO3XX-21 rear plugin to be able to run the model properly, while models in _pcie_ folders are entirely software-based simulations.

Run _motor.mat_ to load workspace variables for the PMSM motor.
